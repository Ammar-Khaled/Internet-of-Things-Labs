# IoT Labs
These labs were done for the **Internet of Things (IoT) course** during my **CS Bachelor studies** at **Zagazig University** in **the Spring of 2024**.

- [Lab 1: Introduction to IoT](./Lab1_two_blinking_leds/) <br>
This lab introduces the basic concepts of IoT and the Arduino board. We learned how to use the Arduino IDE to write and upload code to the Arduino board. We connected two LEDs to the Arduino board and wrote a simple program to blink the LEDs, and we used a push down button to control the built-in Arduino LED.<br> [tinkercad simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jjODFFTJr7L-two-blinking-ledsammar-khaled/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard&sharecode=U4Y4mwfI-_Q6p27jxk5DyxxhNxIjvNlCy5WCfM8mmRI)

- [Lab 2: Sensors and Actuators](./Lab2_ultrasonic_and_servo/) <br>
This lab introduces the concept of sensors and actuators. We learned how to use an ultrasonic distance sensor and a servo motor with the Arduino board. We wrote a program to control the servo motor based on the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.<br> [tinkercad simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5HeIeu00U9B-brilliant-blad/editel?sharecode=gLvJOvUHIFUJHz24WoKuy_V6EYouNrSqMxHpID-XXBY)

- [Lab 3: IoT and Cloud Computing](./Lab3_esp_to_cloud/)<br>
This lab introduces the concept of cloud computing and how it can be used with IoT devices. We learned how to use the ThingSpeak cloud platform to store the data read from ultrasonic distance sensor connected to the ESP32 board.<br> [wokwi simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/396270702461910017)

- [Lab 4: ESP32 wifi modes and web servers](./Lab4_wifi_modes_and_web_server/)<br>
This lab introduces the ESP32 wifi modes and how to use it to connect to a wifi network and create a web server that sends a welcome messages to their clients.<br> [wokwi simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/397939827943464961)


- [Lab 5: IoT protocols](./Lab5_mqtt_pub_sub/)<br>
This lab introduces the concept of IoT protocols and how they are used to communicate between IoT devices. We learned how to use the MQTT protocol to send and receive messages. We used an ESP32 board with an ultrasonic sensor as a publisher to the MQTTX broker.<br> [wokwi simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/397770708708455425)
